The lamp seeks to explore our relationship with dynamic data, for this instance weather. How much do we really need to know? When is a qualitative understanding of data sufficient? The lamp is also a sort of commentary on the current state of culture in Japan. It is no coincidence that the lamp resembles a tower crane. The lamp bridges the gap between traditional Japanese culture and Japan as a world-leading technological hub. The Lamp is a collaboration between Massart’s graphic design program and MIT’s Architectural Computation department. The following pages detail the CAD models and a bit of the building process for the first of the 3 proposed lamps, this is the smallest desk lamp. Further on there is a glimpse into the program written to aggregate weather sources as well as a web-interface designed to program + control the lamp.",
