Driven by a passion for innovation and cross disciplinary collaboration, he sees the world through the lens of design. His work focuses on the intersection of people and technology, weaving lessons from natural systems into creative solutions, delightful interactions, and computational models.<br><br>Having split his undergraduate years between MassArt and MIT Media Lab, he ocuppies the cross-disciplinary space between the physical and the digital, data and expression; a radical atom if you will. He loves setting beautiful typography, the careful design of information, generative physics, and crafting delightful interactive narrative experiences across devices and platforms.<br><br>By harnessing the power of advanced 3D graphics and VR technology, Alex is able to communicate the impact of complex scientific findings to the public.<br><br>Alex’s visualizations have been featured at TED, Tribeca Film Festival, and in Times Square NYC. His renderings have appeared in Wired magazine, the New York Times, and Nature scientific journal.<br><br>When not designing, Alex can be found in search of the perfect breeze, windsurfing or sailing off the coast of Cape Cod.<br><br><a target='_blank'>Résumé</a>",
