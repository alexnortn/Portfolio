The lamp seeks to explore our relationship with dynamic data, for this instance weather. How much do we really need to know? When is a qualitative understanding of data sufficient? The lamp is also a sort of commentary on the current state of culture in Japan. It is no coincidence that the lamp resembles a tower crane.

The Lamp is a collaboration between Massart’s graphic design program and MIT’s Architectural Computation department.
