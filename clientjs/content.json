                "brief": "At SeungLab scientists study Connectomics, a specialty in the domain of Neuroscience which seeks to understand brain structure and function by constructing comprehensive maps of the connections between neurons. Traditionally, Connectomics is a tedious and time consuming process performed by manually tracing through a volume of micrographs like a 3D coloring book. To glean meaningful information from biological neural networks, many thousands of neurons must be reconstructed. Researchers at SeungLab specialize in volumetric neuron reconstruction and employ sophisticated Machine Learning + Computer Vision techniques in collaboration with expert tracers to rapidly accelerate this process.",
                "challenge": "To catalogue the complexity of the human brain, researchers at Seunglab are working towards an automated pipeline for gathering and processing experimental data. However, neuroscience has a data problem and Seunglab is no exception. Researchers have an excess of data and a lack of investigative power. The scale of today’s scientific challenges demand cross–disciplinary collaboration. Collaboration presents an opportunity for teams to leverage each others specialties to move faster and tackle larger and more important problems. Collaboration necessitates sharing of knowledge, time, ideas, skills, and increasingly data. How can researchers at Seunglab benefit from collaboration?"

The lamp seeks to explore our relationship with dynamic data, for this instance weather. How much do we really need to know? When is a qualitative understanding of data sufficient? The lamp is also a sort of commentary on the current state of culture in Japan. It is no coincidence that the lamp resembles a tower crane. The lamp bridges the gap between traditional Japanese culture and Japan as a world-leading technological hub. The Lamp is a collaboration between Massart’s graphic design program and MIT’s Architectural Computation department. The following pages detail the CAD models and a bit of the building process for the first of the 3 proposed lamps, this is the smallest desk lamp. Further on there is a glimpse into the program written to aggregate weather sources as well as a web-interface designed to program + control the lamp.",

These metrics will be used to explore and compare the patterns of spatial organization for different cities in search for the laws describing the location of amenities as a function of distance and other amenities. Finally, we will explore how these metrics can be used to advice policy makers and developers involved in the construction of new cities.",

When using any media player the user often experiences the heads up display as an interruption, intrusion and invasion onto the stage of the screen.

The lamp is also a sort of commentary on the current state of culture in Japan. It is no coincidence that the lamp resembles a tower crane. The lamp bridges the gap between traditional Japanese culture and Japan as a world-leading technological hub. The Lamp is a collaboration between Massart’s graphic design program and MIT’s Architectural Computation department. The following pages detail the CAD models and a bit of the building process for the first of the 3 proposed lamps, this is the smallest desk lamp. Further on there is a glimpse into the program written to aggregate weather sources as well as a web-interface designed to program + control the lamp.",

The lamp seeks to explore our relationship with dynamic data, for this instance weather. How much do we really need to know? When is a qualitative understanding of data sufficient? The lamp is also a sort of commentary on the current state of culture in Japan. It is no coincidence that the lamp resembles a tower crane. The lamp bridges the gap between traditional Japanese culture and Japan as a world-leading technological hub. The Lamp is a collaboration between Massart’s graphic design program and MIT’s Architectural Computation department. The following pages detail the CAD models and a bit of the building process for the first of the 3 proposed lamps, this is the smallest desk lamp. Further on there is a glimpse into the program written to aggregate weather sources as well as a web-interface designed to program + control the lamp.",

                "brief": "Inspired by Charles and Ray Eames’ canonical Powers of Ten, the course explores the relationship between science and engineering through the lens of Design. It examines howtransformationsin science and technology have influenced design thinking, and vice versa. It oòers interdisciplinary tools and methods to represent, model, design and fabricate objects, machines, and systems. Structured as core lectures and lab sessions, the course is organize by systems: Designing Data, Designing Materiality, Designing Life and Designing Nature. World-renowned designers, scientists and engineers will contribute with guest lectures. Within a workshop setting, we will design things - material and immaterial; we will learn new computational and fabrication tools along the way; we will develop methodologies for design research of interdisciplinary problems; we will practice what it means to think, live, and breathe Design.<br><br>The course creates a new pedagogical paradigm for learning and education, which cuts across various disciplines and scales to demonstrate that design is not a discipline, but a way of looking at the world; one that promotes the synthesis of interdisciplinary knowledge across scales in order to create objects and systems for the greater good. his is partly due to the fact that big, real-world challenges - such as the race to cure cancer, the Mars landing mission and the challenge to design sustainable cities and buildings - require, perhaps more than ever, an interdisciplinary skill set combined with an ability to operate across multiple scales with creativity.<br><br>The history of design innovation provides endless examples of cross-disciplinary innovations and individuals. Buckminster Fuller, for instance, was a designer, a futurist, an inventor, an author and a systems theorist. His designs based on the geodesic dome have influenced not only generations of designers, architects, engineers and urban planners but also chemists, material scientists and physicists, who were inspired by his representation of the physical world. Charles and Ray Eames were mid-century American designers working at a range of scales and in a variety of media, from furniture and military aircraft parts to ûlms and exhibitions. Their experiments in design fabrication and cultural media provide signiûcant references for design education today. An example of the value of learning across disciplines today is found in Siddhartha Mukherjee’s book, Emperor of All Maladies: a Biography of Cancer, which tells the story of how the process of inventing cell dyes to trace the growth of cancerous tissues was actually inspired by textile design.<br><br>Design has expanded to include a broad range of scales and disciplines, shifting from the production of objects to the design of experiences, data, networks, territories, and social frameworks. Designers are no longer exclusively committed to design autonomous objects (buildings, cars, furniture and household products), but rather are conceiving and testing whole ecologies of design experiences (robotic construction systems, transportation systems, health care experiences, water distribution, and clean energy). his has prompted Tim Brown, CEO of the design consultancy ûrm IDEO to state, Design is too important to be left to designers. he scope of design ecologies is so broad and so integrated with other disciplines that traditionally trained designers are ill equipped to tackle the new breadth of design tasks at hand. Interdisciplinary teams must work together to design the systems, experiences, environments and futures for our increasingly complex world. Design Across Scales, Disciplines and Problem Contexts responds to this challenge by creating a course that is not a traditional design course for designers, but one about culture, science and technology serving as a foundation course for all students regardless of their major",

The lamp seeks to explore our relationship with dynamic data, for this instance weather. How much do we really need to know? When is a qualitative understanding of data sufficient? The lamp is also a sort of commentary on the current state of culture in Japan. It is no coincidence that the lamp resembles a tower crane. The lamp bridges the gap between traditional Japanese culture and Japan as a world-leading technological hub. The Lamp is a collaboration between Massart’s graphic design program and MIT’s Architectural Computation department. The following pages detail the CAD models and a bit of the building process for the first of the 3 proposed lamps, this is the smallest desk lamp. Further on there is a glimpse into the program written to aggregate weather sources as well as a web-interface designed to program + control the lamp.",

The lamp seeks to explore our relationship with dynamic data, for this instance weather. How much do we really need to know? When is a qualitative understanding of data sufficient? The lamp is also a sort of commentary on the current state of culture in Japan. It is no coincidence that the lamp resembles a tower crane. The lamp bridges the gap between traditional Japanese culture and Japan as a world-leading technological hub. The Lamp is a collaboration between Massart’s graphic design program and MIT’s Architectural Computation department. The following pages detail the CAD models and a bit of the building process for the first of the 3 proposed lamps, this is the smallest desk lamp. Further on there is a glimpse into the program written to aggregate weather sources as well as a web-interface designed to program + control the lamp.",

The lamp seeks to explore our relationship with dynamic data, for this instance weather. How much do we really need to know? When is a qualitative understanding of data sufficient? The lamp is also a sort of commentary on the current state of culture in Japan. It is no coincidence that the lamp resembles a tower crane. The lamp bridges the gap between traditional Japanese culture and Japan as a world-leading technological hub. The Lamp is a collaboration between Massart’s graphic design program and MIT’s Architectural Computation department. The following pages detail the CAD models and a bit of the building process for the first of the 3 proposed lamps, this is the smallest desk lamp. Further on there is a glimpse into the program written to aggregate weather sources as well as a web-interface designed to program + control the lamp.",

The lamp seeks to explore our relationship with dynamic data, for this instance weather. How much do we really need to know? When is a qualitative understanding of data sufficient? The lamp is also a sort of commentary on the current state of culture in Japan. It is no coincidence that the lamp resembles a tower crane. The lamp bridges the gap between traditional Japanese culture and Japan as a world-leading technological hub. The Lamp is a collaboration between Massart’s graphic design program and MIT’s Architectural Computation department. The following pages detail the CAD models and a bit of the building process for the first of the 3 proposed lamps, this is the smallest desk lamp. Further on there is a glimpse into the program written to aggregate weather sources as well as a web-interface designed to program + control the lamp.",
