                "brief": "At SeungLab scientists study Connectomics, a specialty in the domain of Neuroscience which seeks to understand brain structure and function by constructing comprehensive maps of the connections between neurons. Traditionally, Connectomics is a tedious and time consuming process performed by manually tracing through a volume of micrographs like a 3D coloring book. To glean meaningful information from biological neural networks, many thousands of neurons must be reconstructed. Researchers at SeungLab specialize in volumetric neuron reconstruction and employ sophisticated Machine Learning + Computer Vision techniques in collaboration with expert tracers to rapidly accelerate this process.",
                "challenge": "To catalogue the complexity of the human brain, researchers at Seunglab are working towards an automated pipeline for gathering and processing experimental data. However, neuroscience has a data problem and Seunglab is no exception. Researchers have an excess of data and a lack of investigative power. The scale of today’s scientific challenges demand cross–disciplinary collaboration. Collaboration presents an opportunity for teams to leverage each others specialties to move faster and tackle larger and more important problems. Collaboration necessitates sharing of knowledge, time, ideas, skills, and increasingly data. How can researchers at Seunglab benefit from collaboration?"

The accuracy of these views is dramatically improved by implementing virtual cameras with othographic projection as an alternative to standard perpsective projection. To facilitate swift comparisions we created a set of 3D control buttons for quick snapping between views and projections."

The lamp is also a sort of commentary on the current state of culture in Japan. It is no coincidence that the lamp resembles a tower crane. The lamp bridges the gap between traditional Japanese culture and Japan as a world-leading technological hub. The Lamp is a collaboration between Massart’s graphic design program and MIT’s Architectural Computation department. The following pages detail the CAD models and a bit of the building process for the first of the 3 proposed lamps, this is the smallest desk lamp. Further on there is a glimpse into the program written to aggregate weather sources as well as a web-interface designed to program + control the lamp.",

These metrics will be used to explore and compare the patterns of spatial organization for different cities in search for the laws describing the location of amenities as a function of distance and other amenities. Finally, we will explore how these metrics can be used to advice policy makers and developers involved in the construction of new cities.",

This citizen science human-based computation game challenges players to map 3D neurons in a retina. Eyewire was officially launched on December 10, 2012 and has since grown to over 200,000 players from 150 countries. Eyewire gameplay advances neuroscience by helping researchers discover how neurons connect to process visual information. Anyone, anywhere can help neuroscientists develop advanced artificial intelligence and computational technologies for mapping the connectome. In Eyewire, gamers solve 3D puzzles. As they solve the puzzles, they are actually reconstructing 3D models of neurons at nanoscale resolution from electron microscopy images. Eyewire requires no scientific background to play and works best on high speed internet.",
                "challenge": "I was tasked with directing and developing the identity system, supporting brand materials, and promotional assets for 'The DiG', Eyewire's next big Adventure. Based on the nature of the game and a potential throwback to pychedelic rock anthem, we framed the challenge as a 'Journey into the depths of the retina'. The formal language was inspired by digital aspects of the neuron reconstruction, while the asset behavior was inspired by the computational processes of active neurons and cellular automata. The wordmark is composed of sixteen individual squares relating to the sixteen sectors of the scientific endeavor."

Inspired by Neri Oxman's + Meejin Yoon's 'Design Across Scales' MIT Media Lab course, and naturally, Charles and Ray Eames’ canonical Powers of Ten, DAS explores the relationship between science and engineering through the lens of Design. It examines how transformations in science and technology have influenced design thinking, and vice versa. It explores interdisciplinary tools and methods to represent, model, design and fabricate objects, machines, and systems. DAS is organized by scale, topics ranging from the macro to micro are investigated across multiple problem contexts to demonstrate that design is not a discipline, but a way of looking at the world; one that promotes the synthesis of interdisciplinary knowledge across scales in order to create objects and systems for the greater good.",

Design the layout system, develop the brand and identity system, and assemble all of the content. And make it affordable—make it monochromatic. Can you design something people will actually want—imagine a journal for creative frontiers, a journal for the anti-discpliplinary, a journal for design across scales and problem contexts."

Inspired by Neri Oxman's + Meejin Yoon's 'Design Across Scales' MIT Media Lab course, and naturally, Charles and Ray Eames’ canonical Powers of Ten, DAS explores the relationship between science and engineering through the lens of Design. It examines how transformations in science and technology have influenced design thinking, and vice versa. It explores interdisciplinary tools and methods to represent, model, design and fabricate objects, machines, and systems. DAS is organized by scale, topics ranging from the macro to micro are investigated across multiple problem contexts to demonstrate that design is not a discipline, but a way of looking at the world; one that promotes the synthesis of interdisciplinary knowledge across scales in order to create objects and systems for the greater good.",

                "brief": "Simply put, MuWu is a collection of the thoughts and the experience of John Cage. Inspired by the classic text, I Ching, MuWu is intended to ask questions. How is a book composed? What is language and how does it flow? After a single trip to China, John Cage was converted to a Taoist believer. He incorporated chance operations, found in the I Ching, into most of his artworks for the rest of his life. Letting go of intention and embracing the natural flow of tao led Cage to create some of the 20th century's most influential artworks. MuWu pays homaged to to late John Cage by continuing where he left off. The book uses a computational approach to to story telling to fill up exactly 64 body pages with unique content from the compilation, Conversing with Cage. The length was chosen in response to the 64 hexagrams of the I Ching. MuWu attempts to assemble completely new and unique thoughts from the any dialogues found in Conversing with Cage. This approach shifts creative control from the designer towards the algorithm.",
                "challenge": "MuWu was concieved as a student project during my junior year of university. At the time, I was still quite new to programing and just getting my feet wet with the possibilities of design mediated computation. It was a serious risk to take on a full book publication using an unfamiliar technology and ambitious concept. Through the patience of my professors, many, many late evenings debugging, researching, and most importantly a marked propensity for experimentation MuWu came into existance. The final deliverable consisted of a set of eight hand-printed and hard-cover, hand-bound books of exceptional quality. When you leaf through MuWu, you feel none of the struggle, only a clear and simple concept and formal delivery."

It is very curious that this is nearly the same meaning as the Greek letter 'μ' pronounced 'mu' which in modern academia is reference to a very small measurement. The title is appropriate as this text seeks to distance hte design from the final outcome. Both the content and layout of the MuWu are algorithmically sampled. MuWu was sort of my introduction to the possibilities of generative design."

Though highly conceptual, the project proved a gateway to many new ways of thinking and doing. The speed and flexibility of a new parametric graphic design became immediately clear, instead of pushing pixels and setting control points, I was pushing data, and controlling process flow. I used Processing, a language developed for creative coding to generate the content and much of the layout for Muwu."

The Our Epigenomes collection stems from a culmination of life experience. Although we are very close as identical twins and share much of the same genome, my sister and I couldn't be more unique. A lifetime of differing experiences has caused certain traits to develop, uniquely conditioning each of us to our respective environments. Epigenomes are trait differences not caused by DNA, epigenetic modification is occurs slowly, over a lifetime due to these differing experiences.",

The form of the project was a two-week exchange of Japanese and American students—the aim of the project was to promote cultural exchange and foster international collaboration. Although the exchange lasted only two-weeks, we spent months preparing, learning about the history, cultral norms, and common language-isms. The two-weeks spent traveling Japan have been some of the most moving and transformative of my life.",
                "challenge": "We were asked to design simple greeting-cards. The cards should include our name, discipline, and some form of contact information—the rest was up to us. At the time, I was taking traditional graphic design classes at MassArt while exploring the possibilities of design mediated computation at MIT. Most business cards are flat, and strictly information delivery vehicles—at best a business card could be memorable, maybe even novel. What if a business card were multi-dimensional? What if it invited interaction? Could a business card help to overcome a language barrier? I gave myself a single weekend to design, prototype, and fabricate 250 cards. This is the result. "

The prompt was simple, create a response that embodies 'The design of play.'' Instead of trying to invent a new game from scratch we explored classic game design concepts by totally reversing the rules. If the game was played in 2D, how would it feel in 3D? If the game was about destruction, how would it feel being constructed? After loads of playful conversations and paper prototyes, we settled on a concept for a game that could be played either competitively or collaboratively. We called this game Jenga Unchained.",
                "challenge": "I worked on an interdiscplinary team including two architects and an economist. I found it super interesting learning about the motivations of my fellow teammates. Each of us had a different notion of the concept of play, so initial brainstorms were all over the place. What immediately felt like a hinderance led us to a successful melding of minds. The architects pushed for 3D forms with haptics, the economist wanted a system that could be exploited for value, and I was intrigued by the possibility given by modularity. The final game felt like the combination of our unique ideas.",

Driven by a passion for innovation and cross disciplinary collaboration, I see the world through the lens of design. My work focuses on the intersection of people and technology, weaving lessons from natural systems into creative solutions, delightful interactions, and computational models.",

I love setting beautiful typography, the careful design of information, generative physics, and crafting delightful interactive narrative experiences across devices and platforms.<br><br>My visualizations have been featured at TED, Tribeca Film Festival, and in Times Square NYC. My renderings have appeared in Wired magazine, the New York Times, and Nature scientific journal.<br><br>When not designing, I can be found in search of the perfect breeze, windsurfing or sailing off the coast of Cape Cod.",
