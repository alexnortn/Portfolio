Driven by a passion for innovation and cross disciplinary collaboration, I see the world through the lens of design. My work focuses on the intersection of people and technology, weaving lessons from natural systems into creative solutions, delightful interactions, and computational models.",

I loves setting beautiful typography, the careful design of information, generative physics, and crafting delightful interactive narrative experiences across devices and platforms.<br><br>My visualizations have been featured at TED, Tribeca Film Festival, and in Times Square NYC. My renderings have appeared in Wired magazine, the New York Times, and Nature scientific journal.<br><br>When not designing, I can be found in search of the perfect breeze, windsurfing or sailing off the coast of Cape Cod.",
