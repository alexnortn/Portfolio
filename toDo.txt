Consider a strategic movement towards implementing the site improvements:

	Bottom nav bar

		Next
		Prev

		Color change

		Easter egg != mobile

	Add up / down arrow to commands for the scrolling nav

	Nav menu (hamburger) --> fuck velocity (mostly)

	Content on the interactive page

		How do you get this section to read "Web Experiment"

	Consider the alterations to the content on the project page:

		Adding the top grid system

			+ Aligning it to the details box

		Adding the float right content 

			+ Main description

			+ Process

			* All booleans --> repsectfully, sections of the template are triggered by flags set in the <content.json>

				> Allowing for a dynamical templating system

			* Left float the section titles

			* Increase text size dramatically

				> Attempt to simplify the typography across the site

					Heading

					Sub-Heading

					Paragraph

					Caption

		Following the additional content, add a <100% width> image + minor caption

	It's really important that you figure out how to trigger the page transtition event only once on both mobile decices and laptops where the user is used to simply scrolling!

	Finish website

		All above.

			Robust nav, menu, content, images, typography, resume, contact, RESPONSIVE <-- fun


	Explore React
			ThreeJS

	Get excited about typography

	Resolve eyewire onboarding --> we will use text boxes?

		The quesiton there of course is whether or not it's important to consider the mobile scenario

		This is so worth a very intricuit case study. Ughh not as good as Upstatement.. so simple (elegant)

		As little orchestration as possible!

			OK

			So that means like animated in, followed by a form dropdown.

			+++ How will this all come together? Can you move a little faster?

			+++ Consider how it is possible to integrate the cards / mobile dialogue boxes into Eyewire?

			+++ Like how do you deal with such a dark interface?

			+++ Gotta keep pop up boxes pretty neutral

			+++ Accents

			+++ Design process Alex, maybe you could remeber it a little more. It moves forward, and it has discrete steps

			+++ No back tracking
