--------------------------------------------

Consider a strategic movement towards implementing the site improvements:

	Bottom nav bar

		Next
		Prev

		Color change

		Easter egg != mobile

	Add up / down arrow to commands for the scrolling nav

	Nav menu (hamburger) --> fuck velocity (mostly)

	Content on the interactive page

		How do you get this section to read "Web Experiment"

	Consider the alterations to the content on the project page:

		Adding the top grid system

			+ Aligning it to the details box

		Adding the float right content 

			+ Main description

			+ Process

			* All booleans --> repsectfully, sections of the template are triggered by flags set in the <content.json>

				> Allowing for a dynamical templating system

			* Left float the section titles

			* Increase text size dramatically

				> Attempt to simplify the typography across the site

					Heading

					Sub-Heading

					Paragraph

					Caption

		Following the additional content, add a <100% width> image + minor caption
